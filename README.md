## About
Inspired by [this reddit thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/c64/comments/10xfeq1/an_interesting_3d_variation_on_10print_basic/), I wanted to teach myself c64 assembly and decided to take on this as a jumping off point.

All credit for the original version goes to [u/amuletofyendor](https://www.reddit.com/user/amuletofyendor/) for their original idea as well as [8-bit Show And Tell](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VC-lbd8mTOs) for a great video breaking down the logic.

I used [Turbo Macro Pro Assembler](http://turbo.style64.org/) to write the code in the Vice emulator, but it should run on real hardware. Since it wasn't cross compiled, the file maze3d.asm is actually a print-out from TMP to a file. This means the file isn't ready to be compiled as-is and I may add a .d64 image at some point that can be downloaded and executed. I tend to write out any code by hand that I find only to have a better understanding of what each line does.
